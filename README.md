üìå About the Project
Domain Trait-Based Scoring is an intelligent system designed to evaluate and score domain names based on a multi-dimensional trait matrix. The core objective is to automate and standardize how we measure the branding potential, SEO viability, linguistic appeal, and commercial value of domain names ‚Äî especially useful for marketplaces, brand consultants, domain investors, and AI-driven naming tools.

By combining linguistic models, semantic relevance, and business-centric heuristics, the system helps surface high-value domains that align with specific business categories or buyer preferences.

üîç Key Goals:
Standardized Evaluation: Establish a universal, trait-based scoring method that rates domains with consistent criteria.

AI-Augmented Insights: Use LLMs and NLP tools to derive deeper linguistic and semantic insights.

Category-Awareness: Adapt scoring to different startup or business categories (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, AI).

Use-Case Driven: Optimize for real-world use cases like acquisitions, naming tools, or automated suggestions.

üß† Traits Evaluated:
Brevity: Length efficiency for memorability and recall

Phonetic Appeal: Ease of pronunciation, spelling, and linguistic smoothness

Semantic Relevance: Alignment with target industry or concept

Novelty & Originality: Uniqueness and potential for branding

Market Trends: Buzzword alignment, emerging tech, and consumer trends

Extension Value: Value of the domain extension (TLD)
